## Overview

Silent speech recognition enables non-verbal communication by leveraging deep learning models to analyze silent speech signals. This repository provides a complete pipeline for CNN-LSTM-based silent speech recognition, including dataset preparation, training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Using Google Colab

1. Clone this repository in your Google Colab environment:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/sumon3455/Silent_Speech.git
   %cd Silent_Speech
   ```

2. Connect to Google Drive: If you want to use Google Drive for storage, mount it in Colab:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset files and ensure the required code files are available in the Colab instance.

4. Install and Import Required Libraries: Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install torch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio
   !pip install torchvision torchsummary numpy pandas scikit-learn scikit-image ipython Pillow matplotlib seaborn gdown
   ```

5. Run each cell in `Main_pipeline.ipynb` sequentially to execute the complete pipeline.

6. Run Training: Start training the model using:
   ```bash
   !python TrainCNN.py
   ```

7. Run Inference: Set the inference configuration and run:
   ```bash
   !python Inference.py
   ```

8. Inference Time Calculation: Run the script to calculate the inference time:
   ```bash
   !python InferenceTime.py
   ```

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumon3455/Silent_Speech.git
   cd Silent_Speech
   ```

2. Install Python 3.7 or more and the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install torch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio
   pip install torchvision torchsummary numpy pandas scikit-learn scikit-image ipython Pillow matplotlib seaborn gdown
   ```

3. Update file paths in `config.py` to match your local environment.

4. Follow the pipeline steps described below.

## Pipeline

### Dataset Preparation

Ensure that your dataset is correctly structured and placed in the specified directory. Update the file paths in `config.py` as necessary.

### Mean and Std Calculation

To calculate the mean and standard deviation of the dataset, you can either:
- Run the relevant cells in `Main_pipeline.ipynb`.
- Use the `stdmean.py` script.

### CNN-LSTM Training

Check the available models listed in `models.py` or use the output from:
```bash
python TrainCNN.py --help
```

Configure the training parameters in `config.py`, including:
- Number of epochs
- Learning rate
- Dataset mean and standard deviation
- Results directory

Start training the model:
```bash
python TrainCNN.py
```

Rename or organize the data folder as needed before initiating training.

### Inference

Set the inference configuration in `config.py` and run the inference script:
```bash
python Inference.py
```

### Inference Time Calculation

To calculate the time taken for inference, run:
```bash
python InferenceTime.py
```

## Available Models

This repository includes several CNN-based architectures optimized for silent speech recognition. Available models include:
- Inception Networks
- CheXNet
- DarkNet53
- InceptionResNetV2
- Self-ONN
- SqueezeNet
- Xception

Refer to `models.py` for a full list of supported models and configurations.
